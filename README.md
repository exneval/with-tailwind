# Turborepo starter

This is a pnpm turborepo Next.js with Tailwind CSS.

## What's inside?

This turborepo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- `tailwind-config`: `tailwind.config.js`'s used throughout the monorepo
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-app
pnpm run build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-app
pnpm run dev
```

### Docker

This repo is configured to be built with Docker, and Docker compose. To build all apps in this repo:

```
# Create a network, which allows containers to communicate
# with each other, by using their container name as a hostname
docker network create app_network

# Build prod using new BuildKit engine
COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1 DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml build

# Start prod in detached mode
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

To shutdown all running containers:

```
# Stop all running containers
docker kill $(docker ps -aq) && docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
```

To clear space:

```
# Free space
docker system prune -af --volumes
```

### Remote Caching

This example includes optional remote caching. In the Dockerfiles of the apps, uncomment the build arguments for `TURBO_TEAM` and `TURBO_TOKEN`. Then, pass these build arguments to your Docker build.

You can test this behavior using a command like:

`docker build -f apps/web/Dockerfile . --build-arg TURBO_TEAM=“your-team-name” --build-arg TURBO_TOKEN=“your-token“ --no-cache`
